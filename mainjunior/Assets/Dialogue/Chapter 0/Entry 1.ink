Welcome to the dorms! I'm so glad you're here
.........
I've been waiting for you! I've made sure that everything is just perfect
The path to the dorm building is over there. There are a few challenges along the way. Be careful not to fall!
I'm so excited to have you as a roommate. We're going to have so much fun together!
