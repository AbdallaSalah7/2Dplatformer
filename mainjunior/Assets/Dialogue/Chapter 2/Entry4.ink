Hello Again!
I'm a spirit lingering around, and I've got something cool to show you
It's called Sticky Boost Jump
Just Hold down, jump with space, and press 'C' mid-air 
You'll shoot a bit of sticky slime below and give yourself a boost upward.
It's like nature's own elevator, I tell you.
Try it out in this empty room. See that platform up there? Give the Sticky Boost Jump a go and reach new heights!
